Bench of handy scripts making your life easier within the http://i3wm.org/[i3 
window manager].

== Install

Simply clone this repository and add it to your PATH.

== Scripts

=== i3-new-workspace

This helper script jumps to the next numbered workspace available on the 
current screen. For example, if workspaces 1, 2, and 4 are in use, calling this 
script will jump to the unused workspace 3 (equivalent to run `workspace number 
3`). That way, you don't need to look for the next workspace available.

Binding example for your i3 config:

----
bindsym $mod+n exec i3-new-workspace
----
